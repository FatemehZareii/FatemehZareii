									<p align="justify"> &nbsp   &nbsp Recent advances in additive manufacturing (3D printing) of metallic materials have opened new doors to
										the design and fabrication of geometrically patient-specific and mechanically tailored implants for bone
										 tissue reconstruction. An architected internal structure for the implant with a unique design capable of
										  tailoring the mechanical properties of the implant to be analogous to that of the injured bone could improve
										   osseointegration by resolving the stress shielding issue. This work aims to propose a new, simple, fast, and
										   clinically applicable approach for designing the trabecular-like structure of tailored implants, focusing on
										   the tibia component in the knee joint replacement. The conceptual lattice structures with different solid
										   fractions were designed and manufactured using the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technique and Ti-6Al-
										   4V alloy. The mechanical behavior of the structures was computationally and experimentally measured,
										   evaluated, and compared with that of the natural tibia bone. Additionally, the geometrical accuracy of the
										   printed structures is characterized using X-ray computed tomography and microscopic examinations to
										   assess manufacturing robustness with regard to the original design intent. Results showed that the
										   permeability of fabricated structures is between 0.16.10-9 and 0.38.10-9, which is in the range of that of
										   trabecular bones. In addition, the mechanical results indicated that the stiffness and strength of designed
										   structures range from 1.08 to 4.47 GPa and 147 to 295 MPa, respectively, which are reasonably consistent
										   with natural bone. Finally, a conceptual design framework indicating the isolated correlation between the
										   solid fraction of the lattices and the expected biomechanical behavior is proposed. <p>

										<h2>Anisotropy of 3D Printed 316L Alloy</h2>

							</a>
							<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
								<div class="desc">
									<p align="justify" > &nbsp   &nbsp Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology has recently attracted a great amount of attention due to its potential to produce complex parts with precise geometries. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a promising AM method that offers incredible benefits to the medical industry and is widely used for the fabrication of metallic implants with a vast variety in materials selection. One of these materials is 316L stainless steel, which because of its unique properties including particular corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and affordable price, is highly used in the biomedical industry. Considering the critical role of implants, it is necessary to understand their mechanical behavior in each direction of the 3D printing process. Therefore, investigating the relationship between mechanical and microstructural characteristics of 3D printed biomedical alloys in all directions is of great importance. In this study, we fabricated a 316L sample using SLM and compared its anisotropic behavior with a conventionally produced one. The comparison has been done by the means of evaluating mechanical behavior and microstructural analysis in three dimensions. For this purpose, compression and microhardness tests along with X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Optical Microscopy (OM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were carried out. The results reveal the undeniable role of type, size, and distribution of imperfections created during the 3D printing process on the anisotropic performance of fabricated parts</p>

										<h2>Friction Stir Welding Of Dissimilar Al Joints</h2>
									</div>
								</div>
							</a>
							<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
								<div class="desc">
									<p align="justify"> &nbsp   &nbsp  With increased requirements for high performance on engineering structures in different applications, there is demand for not only new materials but also efficient dissimilar joints being able of providing high-integrity joints. The need to join dissimilar aluminum alloys, such as Al 6061 to Al 2024, is common in many industries and applications. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has emerged as a promising welding method for joining aluminum alloys, especially dissimilar ones, with the ability to make a joint with superior mechanical properties. However, for this purpose, there is still a shortage of optimum parameters to make a defect-free joint and thus better mechanical properties. In this study, effective dissimilar joints of Al 6061 and Al 2024 with 6 mm thickness were obtained employing FSW with 4 rotational and 3 traverse speeds. The main aim was to achieve the best mechanical performance including fracture toughness. Evaluation of microstructural features, microhardness, tensile, and fracture toughness showed that a good mixture of base metals can result in perfect properties, while an insufficient mixture allows undesirable defects like the void to be created and weaken the properties. Also, the precipitates demonstrated a profound effect on the mechanical behaviors of the samples. The best performance was represented by the rotational speed of 1250 rpm and the traverse speed of 35 mm/min.</p>

										<h2>Effect of Post-processing Operations</h2>

							<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
								<div class="desc">
									<p align="justify"> &nbsp   &nbsp One of the major problems associated with SLM additive manufacturing is the high surface topography of manufactured parts. In this study, it was tried to improve the surface quality of micro-architected structures with the help of chemical and electrochemical post-processing methods and a combination of them. The effectiveness of each post-processing procedure was evaluated using confocal and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), compression test, ion release, and the Falling Head method. It was found that among the post-processing procedures, the worst and best performance was presented by 15 s electrochemical operation, and 8 s electrochemical followed by a  30-minute chemical operation, respectively. Following the corresponding compression test, it was revealed that the electrochemical treatment led to a relatively high reduction in stiffness (38%), but due to the special geometry of the structure, the stiffness decreased only by 11%. Other operations changed the mechanical properties to a lesser extent and no significant difference was observed among them. All operations improved the permeability by removing unmelted powders which cause obstruction to fluid flow. Also, in the ion release test, all the surface operations reduced the released ions so that they were within the permissible range. In the meantime, iron ions had the greatest decrease.</p>

										<h2>Natural Hybrid Composite</h2>

							</a>
							<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
								<div class="desc">
									<p align="justify"> &nbsp   &nbsp Recently, using natural fibers as reinforcements in composites has attracted much attention. In this study, we employed Goat Hair Fibers (GHF) to fabricate hybrid composites with an effective matrix, which is reinforced with Pine Cone micro-Fibers (PCF). Assessment of mechanical performance of composites and fibers plus scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies demonstrated that both fibers enhance the mechanical properties of composites owing to their good mechanical characteristics and compatibility with the matrix. SEM studies and comparison of measured tensile and flexural modulus with the computed theoretical values by using modified Cox theory revealed that the performance of PCF interface is better than that of GHF due to the presence of lignin in PCF. Furthermore, PCF in hybrid composites has led to amendment of GHF-matrix interface. Investigation of the water absorption mechanism using experimental data and calculated diffusion coefficient values also proved the interface behavior of fibers.</p>
